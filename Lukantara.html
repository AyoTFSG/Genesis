    <p class="para1"> Throughout my academic journey, I gained valuable practical experience through fieldwork, 
        internships, and teaching assistant positions. These opportunities sharpened my skills in 
        geophysical instrumentation, data analysis, and mentoring, enabling me to effectively convey 
        complex scientific concepts. I also developed technical proficiency in seismic, magnetic,
        electromagnetic, and electrical resistivity methods, which deepened my understanding of 
        dynamic Earth processes. </p>
